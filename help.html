                <p>Welcome to the help page for <span class="blue-text">Join</span>, your guide to using our kanban project
                    management tool. Here, we'll provide an overview of what
                    <span class="blue-text">Join</span> is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.
                </p>
    
                <h3>What is Join?</h3>
                <p> <span class="blue-text">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a
                    group of dedicated students as part of their web
                    development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.</p>
    
                <p>Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
                    work-in-progress, and maximize
                    efficiency (or flow). <span class="blue-text">Join</span> leverages the principles of kanban to help
                    users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual
                    interface.</p>
    
                <p>It is important to note that <span class="blue-text">Join</span> is designed as an educational exercise
                    and is not intended for extensive business usage. While we
                    strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent availability,
                    reliability, accuracy, or other aspects
                    of quality regarding <span class="blue-text">Join</span>.</p>
    
                <h3>How to use it</h3>
    
                <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <span class="blue-text">Join</span>:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Exploring the Board <br>
                        <span>When you log in to <span class="blue-text">Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This
                            board represents your project and contains four default lists: "To Do",
                            "In Progress", "Await feedback" and "Done".</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>Creating Contacts <br>
                        <span>In <span class="blue-text">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects.
                            Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in
                            the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact
                            with the tasks on the
                            board.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>Adding Cards <br>
                        <span>Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual
                            tasks. Click the "+" button under
                            the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card, like task name,
                            description, due date, assignees,
                            etc.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li> Moving Cards <br>
                        <span>As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and
                            dropping the card from one
                            list to another.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>Deleting Cards <br>
                        <span> Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a
                            card will permanently remove it from
                            the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is irreversible.</span>
                    </li>
                </ol>
    
                <p>Remember that using <span class="blue-text">Join</span> effectively requires consistent updates from you
                    and your team to ensure the board reflects the
                    current state of your project. </p>
